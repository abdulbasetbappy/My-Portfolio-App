## What is Discover & Share?

Discover & Share is a full-stack clone of Product Hunt built with Node.js, PostgreSQL & Bootstrap.

## Why Did You Build It?

I made this as a project for a web development class in college. I had creative freedom in what to build, and decided to create my own version of one of my favorite web apps at the time, which was Product Hunt.

## How Did You Build It?

The only requirement for projects was that each project had to be built using Node.js, Bootstrap, and MySQL, and be deployed to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I designed and developed the pages using Bootstrap and the Handlebars templating language, and created several different endpoints using Node.js responsible for rendering each page and for doing database operations. Data was submitted to and retrieved from a MySQL database. Every aspect of the project including the database was hosted on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Over time, I migrated the backend to use a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku along with the application.

## What Tools Did You Use?

- **Frontend**: `Handlebars`, `Bootstrap`
- **Backend**: `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `PostgreSQL`
