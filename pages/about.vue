    <p>
      Hello! My name is Abdul Baset Bappy ðŸ‘‹. I craft systems that are
      <span class="highlight">Efficient</span> and
      <span class="highlight">User-Friendly</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">
      I am
      <span class="subtle-highlight">currently seeking opportunities</span>
      to share my passion and expertise.

    <p>
      My interest in software development started back in 2022 when I came
      across the developer community on LinkedIn. I became deeply fascinated by
      it and started to learn more from sources like <span class="highlight">Codecademy</span> and <span class="highlight">W3Schools</span>.

    <p>
      This ultimately influenced my decision to pursue a Course in <span class="highlight">Ostad.com</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While building a strong technical foundation in Course, I dedicated a lot
      of my free time teaching myself web development and building things out.

    <p>
      Over the past year, I have been diligently working on several projects, including <span class="highlight">e-commerce</span> platforms and <span class="highlight">point-of-sale (POS)</span> software. Additionally, I have experience working with <span class="highlight">Node.js APIs</span> and <span class="highlight">Laravel APIs</span>, which has significantly enhanced my skills and knowledge in backend development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working on these projects has deepened my understanding of creating <span class="highlight">scalable</span> and <span class="highlight">maintainable</span> applications, covering the entire development lifecycle from design to deployment. Additionally, I've gained valuable <span class="highlight">communication skills</span> and <span class="highlight">teamwork</span> experience, both in-person and remotely.
